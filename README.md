## 🧩 Problem Description
During Natural disasters or emergency situations,critical information is often scattered,delayed or unreliable,leading to poor coordination and increased risk to lives.The absence of timely,centralised,and trustworthy information creates confusion among citizens and responders during emergencies.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Describe your solution clearly:
- What is your approach?
-  Approach Behind the Problem
During emergency situations, critical information is often delayed or scattered across multiple sources, causing confusion and slow response. The proposed approach is to develop a centralized, web-based emergency information system that provides users with location-based disaster alerts, safety precautions, and emergency resources through a single platform. A website is chosen to ensure easy access across devices without installation.

- How does it solve the problem?
The system centralizes disaster warnings, precautions, emergency contact numbers, and safe location details in one place. By using user location data, it delivers relevant alerts and guidance based on the type of disaster. Instant access to emergency numbers and nearby safe locations helps users respond quickly, while SMS alerts ensure communication even during poor internet connectivity.
- Key idea behind the solution.
Key Idea Behind the Solution

The key idea is to provide a simple, reliable, and location-aware emergency alert platform that delivers accurate information at the right time, helping reduce panic, improve coordination, and enhance public safety during disasters.

## 🖥️ Implementation Details

Explain how your project works:
- The system begins with user registration and login, including email, password, and phone number verification. After authentication, the user completes a profile with personal and emergency contact details. Once logged in, the user is directed to the main dashboard, where disaster alerts and news updates are displayed. Based on the user’s location, relevant warnings and precautions are shown. The user can access emergency numbers, view nearby safe locations on a map, and read disaster-specific precautions. In emergency situations, alerts can also be sent to registered mobile numbers via SMS.
- 
- Key features implemented
- User sign-in with phone number and OTP-based verification (demo logic)
User profile management with emergency contact details
Location-based disaster alert display
Centralized dashboard with emergency information
Quick access to emergency contact numbers
Map-based display of nearby safe locations
Dedicated precautions page for different disaster types
- Any challenges faced and how you solved them
Real-time data and SMS integration were challenging due to time and technical constraints; these were simulated using predefined alerts and demo OTP logic. Location accuracy and privacy concerns were addressed by using location access only with user consent.

## 📂 Project Structure
The project follows a simple, modular website structure to ensure clarity and ease of development. The system is divided into multiple web pages, each handling a specific function. The sign-in page manages user authentication and phone verification. The profile page collects user and emergency contact details. The main dashboard displays disaster alerts, news updates, and provides quick access to emergency numbers, safe locations, and precautions. Separate files are used for styling and logic, with CSS handling the user interface design and JavaScript managing navigation, validation, and location-based interactions. This structured approach improves maintainability and scalability.
